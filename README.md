# Backend-Challenge
TKA Development is a team of builders who value creativity, teamwork, and a positive attitude. We believe that technical skill is important, but we don't judge people based on their background or appearance. We welcome all kinds of builders, creators, and designers, and we're particularly excited to invite developers to take on our open-ended challenge.

At TKA, we're less interested in your formal qualifications than in your ability to create amazing products and learn quickly. If you're up for the challenge, we encourage you to clone our repository and start building! Once you're ready, submit a pull request and our whole team will review your work. We can't wait to see what you create!
